Connecting to a read-only secondary in a SQL Server Always On Availability Group is a common setup for offloading read workloads from the primary replica. 
Here's a step-by-step guide to help you connect properly:

1. Configure the Availability Group for Read-Only Routing
On the server side, make sure:
â€¢	The secondary replicas are configured to allow read-only connections.
â€¢	The read-only routing URL and routing list are set up correctly.
â€¢	The listener is properly configured.
For example, configure like this (on the primary replica):
-- Set up read-only routing URL for secondary replica
ALTER AVAILABILITY GROUP [AGName]
MODIFY REPLICA ON 'SecondaryReplicaName'
WITH (SECONDARY_ROLE (READ_ONLY_ROUTING_URL = 'TCP://SecondaryHost:1433'));

-- Set up the routing list
ALTER AVAILABILITY GROUP [AGName]
MODIFY REPLICA ON 'PrimaryReplicaName'
WITH (PRIMARY_ROLE (READ_ONLY_ROUTING_LIST = ('SecondaryReplicaName')));

 2. Make Sure Read-Only Routing Is Enabled on Secondary
The replica's availability mode should allow read access when it's secondary:
-- Check or set secondary replica settings
ALTER AVAILABILITY GROUP [AGName]
MODIFY REPLICA ON 'SecondaryReplicaName'
WITH (
    SECONDARY_ROLE (ALLOW_CONNECTIONS = READ_ONLY)
);


âœ… 3. Connect via the Listener for Read-Only Routing
When connecting, use the Availability Group listener name and add these parameters:
â€¢	ApplicationIntent=ReadOnly
â€¢	Optionally: MultiSubnetFailover=True if using multiple subnets
ðŸ§ª Example Connection Strings:
SQLCMD:
sqlcmd -S ListenerName -d DatabaseName -E -K ReadOnly

ADO.NET:
Server=ListenerName;Database=DBName;Integrated Security=True;ApplicationIntent=ReadOnly;

JDBC:
jdbc:sqlserver://ListenerName:1433;databaseName=DBName;applicationIntent=ReadOnly;

Important Notes:
â€¢	If you connect directly to a secondary, it must allow read-only access and the connection must not require redirection.
â€¢	Read-only routing only works when connecting to the listener, not when connecting directly to the secondary server unless explicitly allowed.
