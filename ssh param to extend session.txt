 Keep-Alive (Idle Timeout Prevention)
Prevent disconnection during idle periods:

bash

ssh -o ServerAliveInterval=60 -o ServerAliveCountMax=3 user@host

This tells the SSH client to:

Send a keepalive every 60 seconds

Disconnect if no response after 3 missed keepalives

ðŸ§  Effective idle timeout = 60 * 3 = 180 seconds
