ðŸ”„ Prerequisite
Ensure SQL Server Configuration Manager version matches your SQL Server Native Client version (e.g., SQL Server 2019 uses SQL Server 2019 Configuration Manager).

ðŸ”¹ Step-by-Step
âœ… Open Configuration Manager
Start Menu â†’ search for:

SQL Server Configuration Manager

(Exact name depends on your version, e.g., "SQL Server 2019 Configuration Manager")

âœ… Navigate to Aliases
In the left pane:

Expand SQL Native Client Configuration or SQL Server Network Configuration, depending on your driver type:

For 32-bit apps: SQL Native Client Configuration (32-bit)

For 64-bit apps: SQL Native Client Configuration

Click on Aliases.

âœ… Create New Alias
Right-click on Aliases â†’ choose New Alias.

In the New Alias dialog box, fill out:

Field	Value
Alias Name	The name your app will use (e.g., MyDbAlias)
Port No	Port used by the Always On Listener (typically 1433)
Protocol	Select TCP/IP
Server	The Listener DNS name (e.g., AGListener.domain.com)

Click OK to save.

âœ… Test the Alias
From the client machine (where alias was created), test connectivity using:

powershell
Copy
Edit
sqlcmd -S MyDbAlias -d YourDatabaseName -E
Or use SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) and connect to:

nginx
Copy
Edit
MyDbAlias
ðŸ§  Notes
This alias is local to the machine where it's created.

For 64-bit applications, configure the 64-bit alias.

For 32-bit applications (like some legacy apps or certain ODBC drivers), configure the 32-bit alias as well (run C:\Windows\SysWOW64\SQLServerManager*.msc).

If deploying to many clients, you might automate alias creation via scripts or GPO.
