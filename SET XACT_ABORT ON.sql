SET XACT_ABORT ON in SQL Server instructs the database to automatically rollback the current transaction when a Transact-SQL statement raises a runtime error. This ensures that the entire transaction is terminated and rolled back, preventing inconsistencies or partial updates from occurring. [1, 2]  
Elaboration: [1, 2]  

• Transaction Rollback: When SET XACT_ABORT is ON, any error during a transaction's execution will cause the database to roll back all changes made within that transaction, according to Microsoft Learn. [1, 2]  
• Error Handling: This setting is crucial for error handling in stored procedures and other Transact-SQL scripts, as it ensures that partial results or inconsistent data are not left behind in the database. [2]  
• Default Behavior: The default setting for SET XACT_ABORT in a Transact-SQL statement is OFF, according to Learn Microsoft. However, it's ON by default in triggers. [3]  
• Recommendation: It's generally recommended to use SET XACT_ABORT ON in stored procedures with explicit transactions to ensure that errors are handled consistently and that the transaction is rolled back in case of failure, according to Wyzant. [2]  
• TRY...CATCH Blocks: While TRY...CATCH blocks can also be used for error handling, according to Stack Overflow SET XACT_ABORT ON provides automatic rollback, making it a valuable tool for ensuring data integrity in case of errors, according to Stack Overflow. [4]
